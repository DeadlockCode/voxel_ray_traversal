# Stanford 3D Meshes

This folder contains three models from [**The Stanford 3D Scanning Repository**](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/):

- `bunny.ply`: The Stanford Bunny mesh.
- `dragon.ply`: The Stanford Dragon mesh.
- `armadillo.ply`: The Stanford Armadillo mesh.

And one remeshed version where the holes in the original model have been patched and the surface topology has been remeshed:

- `bunny_remeshed.ply`: A remeshed version of the Stanford Bunny.

## Usage

I do not own these models. If you decide to use any of them, please cite [**The Stanford 3D Scanning Repository**](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/) and adhere to their guidelines. You should **not** cite this repository or its maintainer for the models in this folder.
